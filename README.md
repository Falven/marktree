MarkTree enables you to quickly copy workspace directory structures, file contents, and even sets of open tabs as Markdown. With a single click, you can generate a neatly formatted Markdown tree of your projectâ€™s relevant folders and files in code blocks in a format perfect for LLMs.

## Features

- **Copy Md Tree:** Copies a directoryâ€™s tree structure as Markdown.
- **Copy Md Files:** Copies the contents of files as Markdown code blocks.
- **Copy Md Tree & Files:** Copies both the directory tree and file contents as Markdown.
- **Copy Tabs:** Copies the contents of all currently open file-based tabs as Markdown.
- **Copy Tabs to the Right:** Copies only the open file-based tabs to the right of the current active tab.
- **Copy Tabs to the Left:** Copies only the open file-based tabs to the left of the current active tab.
- **.gitignore Support:** MarkTree can optionally respect your workspaceâ€™s `.gitignore` files, so you can copy only the files you want to share (Also allows additional entries via settings).
- **Binary File Skipping:** MarkTree can optionally skip binary files when copying directory contents.
- **Configurable Menus:** Add or remove any of the commands from your context menus, including the tab context menu.
- **Ignore Customization:** Add or remove ignores from a fileâ€™s context menu to fine-tune what files appear in your markdown output.

### Copying Open Tabs as Markdown

If you frequently work with multiple files at once, MarkTree allows you to copy the contents of all currently open file-based tabs as Markdown. This also includes commands to copy only those tabs located to the left or to the right of your currently active tab, providing fine-grained control over what you copy.

- **Copy All Tabs:** Copies all open file-based tabs.
- **Copy Tabs to the Right:** Useful if you want to copy a selection of files opened to the right of the current focus.
- **Copy Tabs to the Left:** Quickly capture the files you've opened to the left side.

## Example: Copying MD Tree

```sh
/Users/falven/Source/turborepo/examples/basic/packages/lib
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json

2 directories, 3 files
```

## Example: Copying MD Files

When you copy files, each file's content is formatted as a code block with an automatically detected language:

src/index.ts

```ts
export const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => {
  console.log('Breakpoint in multiply');
  return a + b;
};
```

package.json

```json
{
  "name": "@repo/lib",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceRoot": "../../packages/lib/src"
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```
